# Packer
Packer scripts for creating up to date AMIs for faster initial boot time.
The sub-folders are named as their respective terraform modules e.g. the scripts 
for creating AMI for the bastion modules are in "bastion" sub-folder.
Creating the AMI in all required regions is a prerequisite for using the ec2, bastion and ecs terraform modules.

## Features
- Updated operating system 
- CloudWatch logging enabled
- CloudWatch agent for collecting additional metrics
- Inspector agent for allowing running of security assessments in Amazon Inspector
- SSM Agent for allowing shell access from Session AWS Systems Manager
- bastion AMI only - `authorized_keys` generated from users in an IAM group

## Requirements
```bash
$ brew install packer
```

## Setup
To create the AMIs, go to the respective sub-folder, edit the `variables.json`, and run:
```bash
packer build -var-file=variables.json ami.json
```

## Input - these are located in variables.json
- **profile** the profile to use in the shared credentials file for AWS. 
- **ami_regions:** a list of regions to copy the AMI to. Tags and attributes are copied along with the AMI. 
- **region:** the name of the region, such as us-east-1, in which to launch the EC2 instance to create the AMI.
